Automatic File Transfer to Google Drive and Google Sheets

This repository contains a program built with Python, Google Drive API, and Google Sheets API that automates 
the process of sending files to Google Drive and writing data to Google Sheets. The program leverages the power of 
these technologies to interact with Google Drive and Google Sheets, allowing seamless file transfer and data management.

Technologies Used

Python
Python is a versatile and widely used programming language known for its simplicity and readability. 
It provides extensive libraries and frameworks that make it suitable for various tasks. In this project, Python serves as 
the core programming language for implementing the logic and interacting with the Google Drive and Google Sheets APIs.

Google Drive API
Google Drive API provides programmatic access to Google Drive, allowing developers to manipulate files, folders, and metadata. 
With the API, you can create, upload, update, and manage files on Google Drive. In this project, the Google Drive API is utilized
